Best Anti Locks/Desyncs


# Desync 
If player locks on you they will be shooting no where near you.

# Underground
If locked on they shoot below you

# Sky
If they lock on you, they are shooting in the clouds

# Moonwalk
It really just fucks with the lock because you're going opposite of what you're pressing (Ex: Pressing W puts you backwards etc.)

# Blatant 
You're just flying around LOL
